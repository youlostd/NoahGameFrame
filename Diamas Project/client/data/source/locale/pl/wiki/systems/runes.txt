[CENTER_ALIGN]Over the past decades, knowledge of the Runes began to spread around N2, as more were unearthed. 
[CENTER_ALIGN]The world's brightest minds, shamans, have studied thoroughly the ancient glyphs, collected 
[CENTER_ALIGN]information from the depths of the history and attempted to gather and determine the powers that 
[CENTER_ALIGN]they could possess. The sheer power held within them, was nowhere close to being translated and 
[CENTER_ALIGN]manipulated by our hands. Some surmised that their powers lured Jotun Thrym into the, as of today known, 
[CENTER_ALIGN]world of N2. Those we managed to subdue are the ones nowdays people are using. Who knows what 
[CENTER_ALIGN]else is left in the depths of Metin2.

[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=18;COLOR=58ADFF]1. Introduction of the Rune System

The system allows players to customize their character growth for specific tasks, such as PvP & PvM, 
by choosing from a wide variety of Runes. You can reach the system through the F5 shortcut.

[COLOR=ef4f00;FONT_SIZE=15]1.1 Primary Trees
There are 5 different Primary Trees that the player can choose to work on: 

*Precision
*Dominance
*Magic
*Determination
*Inspiration

After the player has picked his Primary Tree, he selects a Key Rune and 3 more 
runes to complete his tree based on his needs.

[COLOR=ef4f00;FONT_SIZE=15]1.2 Secondary Trees
Secondary Trees are combined with the Primary Trees to forge a complete Rune Page. 
The player picks another tree to combine and then selects 2 runes from that tree(Key Runes excluded)

[COLOR=ef4f00;FONT_SIZE=15]1.3 Control Buttons
In the top right corner of the Rune System Tab, you can find 4 control buttons: 

*Reset
*Reset Points
*Buy Points
*Save

In the bottom right corner of the Rune System Tab, you can find the Rune System Tutorial 
along with the 4 available Rune Pages. To switch between the Trees, click on the Tree Icon 
on the top before you save the Rune Page. When all 6 runes have bee unlocked and selected, 
you can save the current Rune Page to apply it to your character. Saved Runes can be reset 
with the 'Reset Points' button and saved Rune Pages can be reset with the "Reset" button.
Runes that are active appear in your affect list, in the top left corner of your screen.


[IMG=d:/ymir work/ui/wiki/divider_long.tga; Y=680; CENTER_ALIGN]

[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=18;COLOR=58ADFF]2. How to unlock runes?

To unlock a Key Rune (or a normal rune), you need 12 Rune Points.

[COLOR=ef4f00;FONT_SIZE=15]2.1 Rune Points
You can buy 1 Rune Point through the 'Buy Points' button in the top right corner of the Rune System Tab.
In the beginning and until you have 145 Rune Points, a Rune Point will require items from the 110Lv metin stones, 
in the 90Lv maps & 6.000.000 yang. After the 145th Rune Point and until the 720th Rune Point (max),
Rune Points will require items from the Metin of the Tree Beings, in 105Lv maps & 6.000.000 yang.

[COLOR=ef4f00;FONT_SIZE=15]2.2 Unlocking & Selecting a Rune
When you have 12 points available, click on the Rune you would like to unlock. After that, 
select the rune with the left mouse button and then press 'Save' for the bonuses to apply.
Attention: Now your page is saved and you cannot swap trees. If you'd like so, 
go the the second Rune Page and start over.

[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=18;COLOR=58ADFF]3. Frequently Used Tree Paths & Pro Tips

[COLOR=ef4f00;FONT_SIZE=15]3.1 PvM popular Tree Path (for metin stones)
Primary Tree, Dominance: Soul Robbery, Monster, Boss, Metin.
Secondary Tree, Precision: Average Damage, Critical Damage.

[COLOR=ef4f00;FONT_SIZE=15]3.2 PvM popular Tree Path (for bosses)
For boss farming, you usually go with the tree path for metin stones and you change the "Metin" 
and the others to the most convenient Rune. For example: 
During a Zodiac Temple run, it's easier if you switch "Metin" to "Zodiac" rune and so on...

[COLOR=ef4f00;FONT_SIZE=15]3.3 Pro Tips
When killing a boss, switching to 'Thief' and 'Itemdrop' runes in another Rune Page at the last 
moment will maximize your chances for loot. The Rune 'Reinforced Dew Potions' should be used 
before you enable dews in order to receive greater amount of buffs. You need 1140 pieces of each item 
from the 90Lv maps & 3450 pieces of each item from the 105Lv maps to unlock all the available Lv1 runes.
As soon as you unlock 12/12 runes from your Primary Tree, you also receive a bonus of 
15% Strong against Half Human & 10% Defense against Half Human.

[IMG=d:/ymir work/ui/wiki/divider_long.tga; Y=5500; CENTER_ALIGN]

[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=18;COLOR=58ADFF]6. Terminology

Here we will give a more detailed insight on the terminology used above, in the runes description.

[COLOR=ef4f00;FONT_SIZE=15]6.1 Basic Attack
Every single attack made with your weapons or bare hands counts as basic attack. One basic attack starts when the 
attack animation begins, and ends when the attack animation is finished. Every weapon type (including fists) 
except the daggers do one attack animation when you hit the space one time (of course if you hold the space down 
your character does multiple attack animation depending on your active combo skill and the weapon you use).
Daggers do two attack animations during one hit, so it counts as 2 basic attacks.
If your basic attack does not hit any type of character, or the basic attack is blocked or dodged, 
it does not counts as basic attack. If you deal damage to multiple targets under one attack animation, 
it still counts as maximum 1 (2 if using daggers) basic attack (if all of your targets block or dodge that attack, 
it counts as 0, but if at least one of the targets can not block or can not dodge the attack, it counts as maximum.

[COLOR=ef4f00;FONT_SIZE=15]6.2 Skill Attack/Use
In the rest of the guide we only use the phrase skill for those non basic attack abilities that deals non negative 
damage to one or more targets (excluding your character). Every wave of damage counts as one skill. 
However, one wave of damage counts only once no matter how much target it hits. 
(If it does not hit any target, it counts as 0.)
Spirit Flame counts as a skill every time a flame leaves the caster and deals damage to one or more target 
(still only counts as one skill per flame). Some skills have more wave of damage, 
for example the Three Way Cut counts as 3 skills.

[COLOR=ef4f00;FONT_SIZE=15]6.3 Out of combat
A character considered as out of combat if it does not receive any type of positive damage for a short period. 
The damage is checked after the resistances.

[COLOR=ef4f00;FONT_SIZE=15]6.4 In combat
The exact and full opposite of "out of combat", so if you are not "out of combat", you are "in combat".

[COLOR=ef4f00;FONT_SIZE=15]6.5 Shield or magic shield
With this new runes we introduce a new element in the game called shields.
We distinguish two types of shields: Magic shields, Normal shields.

[COLOR=ef4f00]6.5.1 Magic shields only mitigate magic damages, normal shields mitigate every type of damage.
Also shields have two different status: Active, Inactive

[COLOR=ef4f00]6.5.2 Shield Function
The mechanics of the shields is very simple: When you are about to receive damage, the damage 
will be mitigated by your active shields. So if you have 1000 active normal shield and you 
receive 800 damage, you will lose 800 active normal shield, but you will not lose any HP. 
The damage to the shields is always calculated after the resistances, so for example the 
damage will be mitigated by the sura's black shield first. If you have active magic shield and 
active normal shield and you receive magic damage, the damage will be mitigated by the magic shield first.

[COLOR=ef4f00;FONT_SIZE=15]6.6 True Damage
This is a new type of damage which ignores all type of resistances/defences. 
This damage can only be mitigated by active normal shields. However, 
the Debuff of the Hydra in the ship defense dungeon is applied to this type of damage too.

[COLOR=ef4f00;FONT_SIZE=15]6.7 Base Maximum Health
Your maximum health without any kind of bonus.

[COLOR=ef4f00;FONT_SIZE=15]6.8 Disconnecting, teleport or changing runes will reset your rune related stats, including all types of shields. 
Only the collected boss Souls (from Soul Robbery) are saved.
