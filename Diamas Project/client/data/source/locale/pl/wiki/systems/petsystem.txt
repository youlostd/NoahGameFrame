1. General

There are pets that are different from the ordinary ones. These can be leveled and thus 
also improve. Every monster that can be found on the server can drop as such a pet.
You can open the pet window by pressing the "x" key.

2. Leveling

These special pets are levelable. Not only do they get status points, which you can 
distribute, but they also grow in size parallel to the level. 
To level your pet you need: 

- Level-Pet-Food (1-10)
- Level-Pet-Food (10-30)
- Level Pet Food (30-60)
- Level Pet Food (60-100)
- Level Pet Food (100-150)

These are the items you drag onto your levelable pet to increase its level.

3. Status points

After you open the pet window, you can distribute status points you received there. 
At level 150 there are 447 status points available for distribution. You can distribute 
them to the bonuses. The bonuses are also switchable with the item "Pet-Switcher". 
Switching the bonuses automatically resets the status points, which you can then redistribute. 
The other bonuses must first be unlocked by leveling up. 
The distribution is as follows:

- From level 1: 2 bonuses
- From level 10: 3 bonuses
- From level 30: 4 bonuses
- From level 60: 5 bonuses
- From level 100: 6 bonuses
- From level 150: 7 bonuses

With the available 447 status points, you can't max all 7 bonuses, so choose wisely.
